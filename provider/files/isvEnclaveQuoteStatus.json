    "GROUP_REVOKED": "The EPID group has been revoked. When this value is returned, the revocationReason field of the Attestation Verification Report will contain revocation reason code for this EPID group as reported in the EPID Group CRL. The content of the QUOTE is not trustworthy.",

In rare situations, after SP retrieved the SigRL from IAS and provided it to the platform, a newer version of the SigRL is made available. As a result, the Attestation Verification Report will indicate SIGRL_VERSION_MISMATCH. SP can retrieve the most recent version of SigRL from the IAS and request the platform to perform remote attestation again with the most recent version of SigRL. If the platform keeps failing to provide a valid QUOTE matching with the most recent version of the SigRL, the content of the QUOTE is not trustworthy.",

The platform has not been identified as compromised and thus it is not revoked. It is up to the Service Provider to decide whether or not to trust the content of the QUOTE, and whether or not to trust the platform performing the attestation to protect specific sensitive information.",

The platform has not been identified as compromised and thus it is not revoked. It is up to the Service Provider to decide whether or not to trust the content of the QUOTE, and whether or not to trust the platform performing the attestation to protect specific sensitive information.",
    "SW_HARDENING_NEEDED": "â€“ the EPID signature of the ISV enclave QUOTE has been verified correctly but due to certain issues affecting the platform, additional SW Hardening in the attesting SGX enclaves may be needed. The relying party should evaluate the potential risk of an attack leveraging the relevant issues on the attesting enclave, and whether the attesting enclave employs adequate software hardening to mitigate the risk.",
    "CONFIGURATION_AND_SW_HARDENING_NEEDED": "the EPID signature of the ISV enclave QUOTE has been verified correctly but additional configuration for the platform and SW Hardening in the attesting SGX enclaves may be needed. The platform has not been identified as compromised and thus it is not revoked. It is up to the Service Provider to decide whether or not to trust the content of the QUOTE. The relying party should also evaluate the potential risk of an attack leveraging the relevant issues on the attestation enclave, and whether the attesting enclave employs adequate software hardening to mitigate the risk."
