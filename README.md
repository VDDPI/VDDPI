# VDDPI: Verifiable Decentralized Data Processing Infrastructure

## Overview

VDDPI is a verifiable decentralized data processing infrastructure which is characterized by verifiable the data processing in advance. This verification is performed in the registry and the data provider can get the verification result when data providers receive the data usage application. This verification is independent of a single point of failure because it is performed using the smart contract and recorded in distributed ledgers. This repository provides a proof of concept (PoC), not a product release.

## How to run demo

1. Prepare to use Gramine-SGX and Hyperledger Fabric
   - [Set up the host environment - Gramine documentation](https://gramine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sgx-setup.html)
   - [Prerequisites - Hyperledger Fabric Docs main documentation](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prereqs.html)
2. Clone this repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/adukots/DDIF.git
```

2. Set IP address (Data consumer must use an SGX-enabled machine.)

```bash
$ ./set_addr.sh [Registry IP Address] [Provider IP Address] [Consumer IP Address]
```

4. Start a fabric network (registry) and data provision server (provider)

```bash
$ make run-registry && make run-provider
```

5. Start a data processing app (consumer)

```bash
$ make run-consumer
```

6. Run demo on the consumer side

```bash
$ ./run_demo.sh
```

### Modify the data processing code

If you want to change the data processing code, in addition to changing `consumer/code/main.py`, you need to register with the registry and change the data provision policy.

## Formal Verification with ProVerif

### VSCode

This repository provides `.devcontainer`.  So you can run proverif in a development container if you are using Visual Studio Code.

Details about devcontainer: [Developing inside a Container - Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)



### Building docker container and running proverif

If you are not using VSCode, you can use below commands to run proverif.

```bash
$ docker build -t proverif .devcontainer
$ docker run --rm -it -v ${PWD}/proverif:/home/root/ proverif bash -c "cd ../root/ && proverif main.pv"
```
